# Cheat-Menu-Example
A modern and functional example menu for your Cheats.

### Requirements

- .NET Framework 4.5.0
- Visual Studio (for source view/testing)

### Warning
   
> 1. It requires GUNA.UI, Don't forget to add the DLL to the project. 

> 2. The menu is displayed on top of all games Created in Unity or those that render on OpenGL [Regardless of whether it is in full screen or not.]

> 3. If your game works with Directx, then possibly this cheat menu will not show if the game is in full screen. [You will have to work with the game in Window mode. Or I could work with my [Fake Full Screen](https://github.com/DestroyerDarkNess/Fake-FullScreen)]

> 4. Some Games that work with Directx, Surprisingly the menu works on top of them even if they are in full screen. [For example Operation7, Gunz Ultra]
